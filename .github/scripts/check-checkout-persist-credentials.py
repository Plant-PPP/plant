"""Every actions/checkout step must state `persist-credentials` explicitly.

The upstream default is `true` as of checkout v7, and GitHub offers no repo- or
org-level way to invert it. A local composite wrapper cannot do it either:
`uses: ./...` resolves only once the repo is in the workspace, so it can never
perform the initial checkout.

Stdlib only — no PyYAML: this must fire on a PR that touches ONLY workflow
files, which `turbo run ci --affected` skips (turbo.json `globalDependencies`
excludes `.github/`). So it cannot live in a package's jest suite, and it runs
before dependencies are installed.

    `with:` is required at `key_col` — the column of the step's own keys, where
    `uses:` sits. That single constraint is what makes the check sound, and it is
    load-bearing in a way that is easy to relax by accident:

    * `env:` is a free string map, so `env: {persist-credentials: false}` is valid
      YAML and a valid workflow. The runner accepts it, checkout never receives the
      input, and the token stays in .git/config.
    * A block scalar's body is an opaque string. `env: {NOTE: "with:\n  persist-
      credentials: false"}` looks like structure and is not.

    Both live at a column deeper than the step's own keys — a block-scalar body is
    always indented past its key, and an `env:` child past `env:` — so pinning the
    column rejects them without needing to model block scalars here at all.

    The child level is learned from the first child rather than assumed to be two
    spaces: 3- and 4-space YAML are equally legal. A grandchild does not count.

    Known limitation: a `with:` written ABOVE `uses:` in the same step is not seen,
    because the walk starts at `uses:`. YAML mappings are unordered so that is legal,
    but it fails closed — the step is reported as unconfigured — and no workflow here
    writes it that way.
