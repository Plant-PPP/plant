# The repo is public. Fails if a tracked file, a file name, a staged addition,
# a commit message or the branch name contains a forbidden word. The list
# lives in FORBIDDEN_WORDS (one case-insensitive extended regex) so the word
# itself never has to be spelled out in the repo: set it in your shell profile
# and in the CI secret FORBIDDEN_WORDS. Output never prints matched text, only
# where it is (commit ids, paths that do not match themselves, counts),
# because CI logs of a public repo are public too.
#
# Optional (CI sets the first three, pre-push sets RANGE and BRANCH, and
# commit-msg sets MESSAGE_FILE):
#   REQUIRE_FORBIDDEN_WORDS=1     fail instead of skipping when the list is unset
#   FORBIDDEN_WORDS_RANGE=A..B    also check the commit messages in that range
#   FORBIDDEN_WORDS_BRANCH=name   also check that branch name
#   FORBIDDEN_WORDS_MESSAGE_FILE=path  check only that message, as is
#                                 (commit-msg hook, annotated tags in pre-push)
