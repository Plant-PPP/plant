# The commit message is public once pushed, and pre-commit runs before it
# exists, so it gets its own check. It checks what an editor commit stores:
# the text above the `commit -v` scissors line, without comment lines. The
# scissors line is matched by its fixed suffix, because its leading comment
# string can come from core.commentChar=auto or core.commentString. Under
# `auto`, git picks the comment char per message and stripspace would assume
# `#`, so the char is read from the template line that quotes it ("; with ';'
# will be ignored"), a shape that does not depend on git's language. A
# comment-looking line kept by `git commit -m` is caught by pre-push and CI,
# which read the stored message.
