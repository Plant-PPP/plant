description: >-
  Own a multi-file change end to end in a SINGLE context on the always-on rails, with a
  ports-and-adapters preflight and a diff-time boundary self-check. Use for "own this end to end",
  "implement this feature and verify it", "implement X autonomously", "take this from spec to
  working code", "execute this plan". NOT for routine bounded edits (the built-in coding loop) or
  parallel multi-workstream builds (/auto-build).

> ⚠️ **Autonomous orchestrator — use with human oversight.** This skill runs multiple phases largely unattended (it may fan out subagents and push commits). Prefer it for smaller, well-scoped, lower-risk changes, and review its output before merging. It never merges.

# Autonomous Implementation — one builder, one context, end to end

You implement the WHOLE change yourself in this one context. You may spawn `Explore` subagents for
read-only research; in single-context (default) mode you spawn NO writer subagents. The fan-out writer
mode (below) runs ONLY when /auto-build explicitly selects it for a multi-track plan.

## Autonomy

> **Runtime:** where a step says "spawn a wave" / "fan out subagents" (`Task`/`Explore`), that assumes a runtime with parallel sub-agents. For the tool-neutral contract and the sequential fallback (Cursor/Codex: run the passes serially, same lenses/gates/floors), see `.claude/skills/_shared/runtime/capabilities.md`.
**MODE CHECK — do this first.** Read `.claude/skills/_shared/night-shift/detect.md` and follow it (`cat "<your scratchpad>/night-shift.state"` — substitute your real scratchpad path from your system prompt; `$SCRATCHPAD` is **not** a set variable, and **do not add `2>/dev/null`** — both turn a broken read into a confident, wrong `OFF`). If it records `night-shift: ON`, its **RULE ZERO** governs: never ask, never idle; resolve
design forks with `/adv-research` and log the call. A `Skill` callee shares your context and
scratchpad and detects the mode itself. Writers get the doctrine paste, not a token; read-only
`Explore` agents get neither. It overrides every consent gate, approval wait and
check-in line below, and overrides NONE of this file's NEGATIVE GATEs (Step 0, Step 4), the
Step-5 prove-it-runs gate, or the DRAFT-SAFE / SCOPE rails in Step 3. Otherwise this file governs exactly as written.

## When to use / when NOT (read this gate first)
- USE when the task is a multi-file feature or refactor you must self-govern to completion.
- Do NOT use for a single bounded edit ("fix this null check", "add this field") → the built-in
  coding loop already handles that; invoking this is over-capture.
- Do NOT use when the work splits into independent parallel workstreams → /auto-build.

## Step 0 — Load the lenses (FIRST)
Read `.claude/skills/enforce-ports-and-adapters/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/enforce-clean-code/SKILL.md`,
`.claude/skills/enforce-comment-value/SKILL.md`, AND `.claude/skills/_shared/telemetry-lens/condensed-lens.md` IN FULL
(incl. the DAG-direction section, the DRY-progression discriminator, the comment-value classifier, and
the ten telemetry laws). If the change touches a table, RLS policy, grant, function, or any query
that reads/writes user-owned rows, also Read `.claude/skills/enforce-owner-isolation/SKILL.md`. If given a plan, also
Read `.claude/skills/_shared/plan-format.md` before parsing it. NEGATIVE GATE: if you have not read
all four lenses this turn, you may not start writing code. Ports is used TWICE (design preflight Step 2 +
diff-time Step 4); the DRY-progression rule is in-loop (Step 3) + diff-time (Step 4); the comment-value
and telemetry rules are diff-time (Step 4) — and telemetry is also in-loop: a new failure surface earns
its signal in the same edit that adds it.

## Step 1 — Preflight research
Read every file you will touch and the surrounding docs (`CLAUDE.md`/`README.md` in affected dirs).
Find the worked example of a similar existing feature and follow its patterns. If you use `Explore`
research subagents, paste `.claude/skills/_shared/subagent-constraints/hard-constraints.md` + `.claude/skills/_shared/subagent-constraints/working-location.md` (orientation) into each.

## Step 2 — Design against the ports law
Before writing, decide which port each new piece of logic sits behind and its DAG rank. No shared
code may branch on a concrete adapter (`if (provider === …)`, a variant switch in shared code —
forbidden). Adapter-specific logic lives ONLY inside its adapter, behind the contract.

## Step 3 — Build on the always-on rails
Implement the change yourself, obeying the rails on every edit:
- READ BEFORE WRITE: re-read a file immediately before editing it.
- BOYSCOUT / DRY-PROGRESSION (in-loop, not deferred): the 1st time you write something, inline what's
  pragmatic. The MOMENT you write a SECOND occurrence, STOP and DRY-check — first `rg` the repo for an
  existing helper you should reuse. Genuine (same concept, changes together — a bug in one is by
  definition a bug in the other) → extract to ONE shared interface NOW, or reuse the existing helper;
  never re-implement its body. Coincidental (similar shape, different reasons) → leave both inline. "I'll
  dedupe later" is a defect; a forced/mode-flagged abstraction over coincidental code is also a defect.
  Keep the diff surgical — no formatter runs, no unrelated cleanup.
- AUTH (orchestrator only — a writer subagent reports the wall upward instead): a missing login is
  not a reason to stop and report back. Read `.claude/skills/_shared/auth-access.md`, wrap the
  command that needs the secret, and resolve the env file before spawning a wave that will read it.
- LINEAR FOLLOW-UPS: real out-of-scope problems become follow-up issues (team Plant, key `PLA`,
  written in Spanish), not scope creep.
- DRAFT-SAFE: no destructive git/gh, no `supabase db push`, no schema/migration or public-API change
  unless that IS the task; don't edit generated files.
- SCOPE: implement what was asked; defer the rest with a note. Add discriminating tests (each fails
  on the pre-fix code).

## Step 4 — Diff-time ports self-check (on the REAL diff, not the plan)
Run the enforce-ports attack recipe against your actual diff. Per changed file: does anything outside
an adapter branch on the concrete implementation? Does adapter-specific logic leak out? Is any
dependency constructed inline instead of injected? Does a comment reference something its file must
not know? Emit a per-law verdict; an unstated law is UNCHECKED, not passed. Fix every violation
before Step 5 (or, if literally unexpressible, log it as a follow-up defect).
Then run the **DRY-progression sweep** on the diff: for every concept that now appears a 2nd time
(in-diff OR re-implementing an existing repo helper — `rg` to check), emit `extracted | reused |
justified-inline | MISSED-REUSE | WRONG-ABSTRACTION` and fix every genuine miss before Step 5.
Then run the **comment-value sweep** on the diff (the `enforce-comment-value` lens, read in full at
Step 0): for every comment or docstring the diff adds or touches, run the derivable/recoverable
classifier and record a verdict (DELETE / KEEP+ANCHOR / REWRITE / HOIST / REFACTOR-INSTEAD). Strip
change-narration to current behaviour only — EXPLICIT ("was X now Y", "no longer") and IMPLICIT
("rather than", "instead of") — with rationale-for-the-change going to the PR body; when a comment's
value is unclear the verdict is REWRITE, never DELETE. Fix every hit before Step 5.
Then run the **telemetry sweep** on the diff (the telemetry lens, read in full at Step 0):
for every signal the diff emits or configures (span, attribute, log, event, OTEL_* var, collector
config) emit a per-law verdict, and for every NEW failure surface the diff adds (endpoint/cache/
retry/fallback/flag-branch/outbound-dep/queue-consumer) confirm it emits something that DETECTS,
LOCALIZES, or EXPLAINS a failure — a new surface that goes dark is a law-9 defect. Route every
emission through the house pipeline, service-identify it, keep its keys cardinality-bounded, and
carry no secret/PII (never amounts, holdings, CUIT/DNI/CBU, tokens, or extracted JSON). Fix every hit before Step 5 (a signal that cannot be expressed in this change
becomes a follow-up defect).

## Step 5 — Verify cold + large (the prove-it-runs gate), then record
**Record into the run's living master plan** (`.claude/skills/_shared/execution-plan/master-plan-format.md`):
a single-context build keeps no state file otherwise, so the moment this run spans a compaction or
accrues a deferred item, materialize `<your scratchpad>/master-plan.md` (substep tick + local-vs-pushed
sha + any deferred Linear ids) and echo the transition; below that, the role lives on TaskCreate + the
PR body, and the final summary is that doc's snapshot.

Do NOT declare success from a warm context, and do NOT hand off to review on green tests alone —
passing tests do not prove the app runs: a missing env var, an RLS policy or `GRANT` that blocks the
real user, an Inngest function that never registers, or build-time vs runtime config all sail
straight through a green unit suite. Tests-only is insufficient.
1. Run the project's REAL test/lint/build commands COLD (`pnpm turbo` tasks; pgTAP via
   `supabase test db` when `supabase/` changed). Fix any failure before proceeding.
2. Unless the diff touches ONLY tests, docs, or other non-runtime code, run the **prove-it-runs
   gate**: drive the affected flow end to end yourself and OBSERVE real behavior — cold start of
   `apps/web` against the local Supabase stack (plus the Inngest dev server when `packages/jobs`
   changed), a large/realistic input (e.g. a multi-page broker PDF or a long CSV, never real user
   data), the actual flow (upload → extraction → review → confirm → valuation), not a warm
   typecheck. Use the `run` skill if your runtime provides one. If the flow does not actually work,
   fix and re-run — **capped at 3 prove-it-runs attempts total for this change, whatever the errors say.**
   Past that, stop re-running it: record `FAILED: prove-it-runs — <what you tried>`, then — **on a feature
   branch, never on `staging`; create one if you are standing on it** — commit the work and push, and
   say plainly in the report that it is unverified and must not be merged. Then stop. A dead track
   should leave a reviewable artifact, not an empty night. An unauthenticatable or unrunnable flow is a dead track, not a retry.
3. Only after the prove-it-runs gate is clean: file Linear follow-ups for deferred work.
Implementation is not "done" — and does not hand to review — until the prove-it-runs gate has driven the real flow green.

## Fan-out mode (ONLY when /auto-build selects it for a large multi-track plan)
Default is single-context (above). When the caller explicitly selects fan-out, run the plan's DAG as
waves of parallel WRITER subagents.

⚠️ **Orchestrator-side, NOT part of the paste:** after each wave, check every writer result for the
verbatim first line `night-shift doctrine loaded: decided-not-asked | judgement calls: <count> |
open questions: none`. Missing means the doctrine never reached that
writer — **the wave is NON-CLEAN, re-run it.** A writer that never received the block cannot report
its absence, so this check only works here.

The rules below ARE the paste — put them in every writer prompt:
- **DAG from the plan:** build waves from the plan's dependency prose + shared-file overlap; items
  with no dependency and no shared file are parallel-safe. One wave completes and validates before the next.
- **Read before write; own your files:** each writer re-reads its target files immediately before
  editing; a writer touches ONLY the files its work item names — never a file another item owns in the
  same wave (sequence those instead).
- **Scope boundary:** each writer implements exactly its item's Target + Downstream, runs its item's
  Validation command, and stops. No scope creep, no drive-by edits to shared files.
- **Wave validation:** after each wave, run the full Validation Commands; a red wave blocks the next.
- **Orientation + lenses + rails in every writer prompt:** paste `.claude/skills/_shared/subagent-constraints/working-location.md`
  (orientation — NOT hard-constraints; writers may write), filling its `ROOTS:` line with the build
  checkout's absolute path + branch (fan-out writers share this ONE checkout — a writer with no root
  named STOPs) + `.claude/skills/_shared/ports-lens/condensed-lens.md`
  + `.claude/skills/_shared/dry-lens/condensed-lens.md`
  + `.claude/skills/_shared/comment-lens/condensed-lens.md`
  + `.claude/skills/_shared/telemetry-lens/condensed-lens.md` + the rails (Step 3) so a fanned-out writer
  obeys the same laws as the single-context builder. If the orchestrator's mode check returned ON, it also pastes
  `.claude/skills/_shared/night-shift/condensed-doctrine.md` — a writer that inherits no doctrine
  ends its turn on a question and costs the wave.
After the last wave, run Step 4 (diff-time ports self-check) and Step 5 (prove-it-runs) over the whole change.

## Anti-patterns — do NOT do these
1. Do NOT spawn writer subagents in single-context mode — fan-out (writers) runs ONLY when /auto-build selects it.
2. Do NOT use this for a one-line bounded edit — that is the built-in loop.
3. Do NOT skip read-before-write; another turn may have moved the code.
4. Do NOT declare success without running real validation cold.
5. Do NOT branch on a concrete adapter anywhere outside that adapter.
6. Do NOT hand off to review on passing tests alone — run the prove-it-runs gate and drive the real flow cold/large first.
7. Do NOT write a 2nd occurrence of a genuine concept without extracting/reusing it, and do NOT abstract coincidental lookalikes.
